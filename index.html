                     I'm a passionate marketer seeking to expand its horizons by 
                     delving into the world of coding. This fascinating field will
                     serve as a springboard for me to bring ideas to life.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic where I obtained
                     a Licentiate degree in Marketing. I have a background in real estate
                     and finance having worked in a real estate agency and a credit union. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I'm also passionate about non-profits. I worked at a non-profit school
                     in the Dominican Republic as well as starting a non-profit with my wife.
