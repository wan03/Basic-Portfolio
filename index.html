                    I'm a passionate marketer seeking to expand its horizons by 
                    delving into the world of coding. This fascinating field will
                    serve as a springboard for me to bring ideas to life.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic where I obtained
                    a Licentiate degree in Marketing. I have a background in real estate
                    and finance having worked in a real estate agency and a credit union. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also passionate about non-profits. I worked at a non-profit school
                    in the Dominican Republic as well as starting a non-profit with my wife.
